00:01.340 --> 00:01.900
All right.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.640
It's time to get started with a new section.

00:04.640 --> 00:11.840
We've built our app now to have sign in and sign up functionality but things are starting to get a little

00:11.840 --> 00:13.070
bit complicated.

00:14.230 --> 00:18.100
You see react is a UI library.

00:18.100 --> 00:23.430
It's focusing on the UI as our apps get more and more complicated.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.280
Our state is going to grow.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.920
It's going to get more and more complicated.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.240
And in this section we're going to use a new library called redux to make our ReACT state more scalable.

00:36.400 --> 00:42.950
Now Redux is a pretty tough topic to understand especially if you haven't learned it before.

00:43.060 --> 00:49.420
But the key thing in this section as we progress through the videos which you may have to revisit a

00:49.420 --> 00:53.420
couple of times because there'll be some new terms that we haven't heard before.

00:53.800 --> 01:02.590
But the key takeaway of this section is to understand that our app as it grows becomes more and more

01:02.590 --> 01:06.330
hard to understand how the flow of data is.

01:06.430 --> 01:12.340
And at the end of the day programs are way for us to manage the flow of data.

01:12.490 --> 01:20.870
And if you remember are key to being a good react developer is to decide the state and where it lives.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.900
And this section is all about that.

01:24.110 --> 01:33.380
We're going to be using redux as a state management to really focus on this point so that our code becomes

01:33.380 --> 01:41.780
cleaner our app becomes easier to debug and you'll notice that although redux may be confusing to understand

01:42.320 --> 01:49.070
our app will become easier and easier to understand and how data flows because of redux.

01:49.070 --> 01:50.540
So stick with us.

01:50.540 --> 01:56.030
I know this is gonna be a tough section but state management is a big big topic.

01:56.240 --> 02:03.410
As a matter of fact in this course we're going to talk about things like context API and graph QoL which

02:03.500 --> 02:07.910
are different ways to manage state as well we have lots to get through.

02:07.960 --> 02:08.740
So let's get started.
