WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.880
OK.

00:01.710 --> 00:08.690
The next thing that we have to do is finish building our car dropdown so far our car dropped down.

00:08.710 --> 00:15.670
We're missing the empty message that goes here when the user has no card items as well as the actual

00:15.670 --> 00:20.620
linking of our go to checkout that takes us to our checkout page.

00:20.620 --> 00:28.470
So let's first handle this empty message so inside of our car dropdown component what we'll do is we

00:28.470 --> 00:38.870
will conditionally render a span or our cart items depending on whether or not the cart items array

00:39.290 --> 00:47.990
has a length that's greater than zero right so for us type corrosion of 0 will be false anyway.

00:48.150 --> 00:49.970
So if it's not false.

00:50.110 --> 00:50.360
Right.

00:50.430 --> 00:55.230
If there's a value greater than zero then we'll render our car items.

00:55.230 --> 01:06.010
If there isn't any items then we will render a span with the class name of empty message that says your

01:06.010 --> 01:07.420
cart is empty

01:10.550 --> 01:12.060
of cart items.

01:12.060 --> 01:20.530
Now maybe this is a good time to talk a little bit about type caution in JavaScript so we know that

01:20.740 --> 01:27.620
zero is something that will evaluate to false if I do zero equals false.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.840
We're using the loose equal sign.

01:29.950 --> 01:33.340
So there's two types of equivalence in JavaScript.

01:33.340 --> 01:38.670
There's the double equals and then there's the triple equals double equals just checks.

01:38.680 --> 01:46.180
If the values of the two things are the same and what it will also do is it will try and coerce the

01:46.180 --> 01:49.680
types on the left and the right side that we're comparing.

01:49.720 --> 01:57.340
So let's say for example the string of one and the number of one they'll try and coerce the value of

01:57.340 --> 02:01.900
the string over to a number and then they'll compare the values.

02:01.900 --> 02:06.220
So once the string of 1 becomes 1 while the values of one are the same.

02:06.760 --> 02:13.810
Whereas if we try and do a triple equals we'll find that it gives us false because with the triple equals

02:13.920 --> 02:21.900
that's a strict evaluation which is looking at both the type of what we're comparing and also the value.

02:21.940 --> 02:27.460
So because the type of our string of one is a string and then our type of our number is a number then

02:27.460 --> 02:32.970
we'll get false when we try and do it this way now inside of JavaScript.

02:33.070 --> 02:38.860
There are six type of things that are considered false values which means that if we were to put them

02:38.890 --> 02:45.280
in a conditional like an if statement or our ternary operator then it will return false.

02:45.940 --> 02:51.190
And those six things are zero false undefined.

02:51.520 --> 03:01.340
No not a number and an empty string these six things all await evaluate to false which is why when we

03:01.340 --> 03:09.020
set default values inside of our reducer we tend to set them to the empty version or the false version

03:09.320 --> 03:10.860
of what they'll be.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.930
So if they're going to be an object we set them by default to know if they're going to be a number.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.240
We'll set it to zero.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.260
If it's a string we'll set it to an empty string right.

03:22.300 --> 03:27.980
And if it's true or false if it's a boolean Well that doesn't really matter more so what state we want

03:27.980 --> 03:32.820
that value to be inside of our reducer when an initialize is.

03:32.970 --> 03:39.410
And the reason for this is so that we can conditionally render like the item itself or we can render

03:39.500 --> 03:41.290
an empty state.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.180
Right.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.380
And that's essentially what we're doing here.

03:44.510 --> 03:51.020
We're saying that if the car items length is equal to zero then render an empty message.

03:51.020 --> 03:59.660
If not then we will render out the actual car items and now let's just apply some of the styles that

03:59.660 --> 04:04.130
we need to our empty message inside of our car dropdown styles

04:06.850 --> 04:17.440
and what we'll just say is that empty message class will get the styling where the font size is 18 pixels

04:18.860 --> 04:21.600
and our margin is 50 pixels.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.540
Auto.

04:22.700 --> 04:23.590
There we go.

04:23.900 --> 04:30.740
Now our message is center OK now for our actual go to checkout button.

04:30.870 --> 04:42.720
Well first let's create the actual checkout page so let's go to our app J.S. closes other tabs and also

04:42.750 --> 04:51.930
make a new folder for our page called checkout closes folder and let's make a new folder called checkout

04:52.860 --> 05:00.600
inside we'll just make a basic checkout component after making our usual files.

05:00.700 --> 05:13.080
Checkout styles dot SAS and inside will import react from react import in our style sheet and usually

05:13.080 --> 05:20.170
as we always do we're just going to declare our checkout page and make it a basic functional component

05:20.200 --> 05:23.650
that just renders a div that says checkout page

05:27.170 --> 05:27.570
right.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.210
Just so that we know everything's working let's exploit this by default.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.820
And then inside our objects let's bring it in

05:42.090 --> 05:48.570
and we'll put it underneath all our other pages that we're importing just so that we know that all of

05:48.570 --> 05:51.520
our page components are together in the import statement.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.140
Right.

05:52.200 --> 05:58.710
We can even separate it a little bit so that we can see it a little better if we want to sort them by

05:58.710 --> 06:08.270
their respective sections and then we'll just add a new row here or the exact path goes to our checkout

06:08.270 --> 06:10.200
page when we hit checkout.

06:11.150 --> 06:15.680
Now the reason we're not doing it for shop is because eventually we'll actually do shop slash and then

06:15.680 --> 06:23.830
a category like hats jackets men's or women's but here we'll just add in our route point to our checkout

06:23.830 --> 06:28.240
page because we don't have anything after checkout like there's no slash checkout and then something

06:28.240 --> 06:30.320
else at least not yet.

06:30.340 --> 06:38.580
Now we can think of as far as our app goes And now let's just set up our card dropdown to have our history

06:38.580 --> 06:51.360
action to push it through what we'll need is we will need our with or hired a component from our ReACT

06:51.450 --> 06:52.560
router Dom

06:55.340 --> 07:03.340
and what we'll do is we're actually going to wrap the connected function inside of our with router.

07:03.530 --> 07:12.140
And the reason we can do this is because all of our higher order components if you remember return components

07:12.650 --> 07:16.090
but also take components as their arguments.

07:16.130 --> 07:23.090
So with router is just taking the component that got returned from our connect call as its component

07:23.090 --> 07:32.790
argument now the order in which we wrap them matters because with router will be what passes the match

07:32.880 --> 07:41.120
history and location objects that we first covered when we're looking at our with router component into

07:41.130 --> 07:43.760
the component that is being wrapped.

07:43.830 --> 07:50.880
So we want what comes out of the Connect component to receive those props because when you wrap components

07:50.880 --> 07:56.490
like this it actually evaluates from inside out.

07:56.610 --> 08:05.050
So we'll actually get our connected component first which will then pass in to our with router hired

08:05.050 --> 08:05.990
a component.

08:06.150 --> 08:13.170
And this way our actual component will have access to the props that we're looking for which in this

08:13.170 --> 08:22.350
case is history because what we want this on click to do is just fire the function that will take us

08:22.350 --> 08:34.540
to history push slash checkout and now if we save we see that it takes us to our checkout page okay.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.590
Now let's continue.
