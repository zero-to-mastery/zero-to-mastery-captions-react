00:00.300 --> 00:05.310
Let's make a small modification to our app right now.

00:05.380 --> 00:12.820
If the user signs in they are able to still access the sign and page which we don't want them to be

00:12.820 --> 00:18.400
able to do because they're still able to trigger any of the code in our sign in mess with the author

00:18.400 --> 00:19.290
flow.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.590
We don't want that.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.650
If they're already signed in so how do we do that.

00:24.550 --> 00:33.880
Well what we want to do is we want to set it so that if there have a current user inside of our application

00:34.420 --> 00:36.900
they shouldn't be able to access the sign in row.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.460
And in order to write that code we're gonna need two things.

00:41.470 --> 00:48.010
The first is we're going to need the redirect component from RAC writer Dom and then the second thing

00:48.250 --> 00:52.290
is we're gonna need the current user from our redux date.

00:52.360 --> 01:01.820
So just like we did in our header we're gonna need a concept map state to props and off of our state

01:02.060 --> 01:12.310
we're gonna d structure off our user reducer and what we'll return is our current user prop which is

01:12.310 --> 01:19.660
equal to user dot current user and now we're able to pass are maps.

01:19.660 --> 01:28.110
It's a prop store connect so that we have access to this stop prop stop current user now inside of our

01:28.110 --> 01:37.620
route we're gonna switch this first to exact and then instead of this sign in and sign up component

01:37.620 --> 01:45.450
property we're going to use render and render you can imagine is exactly like the render key that we

01:45.450 --> 01:56.070
use in our class components it's a JavaScript in location that determines what component to return in

01:56.070 --> 02:00.520
the same place where component would be instead it'll be some javascript.

02:00.690 --> 02:04.680
So here we can say that it will be a function

02:07.270 --> 02:14.410
that will determine based off of are this stop prop stock current user.

02:14.410 --> 02:14.700
Right.

02:14.710 --> 02:22.990
Because if it's present then what we want to render is our redirect component that we just imported

02:23.470 --> 02:31.770
and all it takes is that to property that tells it where we want them to redirect to and then if not

02:31.770 --> 02:42.260
that we want to instead render our sign in and sign up page and that's all there is to it.

02:42.590 --> 02:51.150
So now if we go to our app we'll see that we no longer are able to access sign in right.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.930
It'll redirect us.

02:53.310 --> 03:00.030
So now not only do we want that if we hit sign out and let's say we got to sign in.

03:00.030 --> 03:04.310
If we sign in it should redirect us to our home page.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.210
Okay.

03:05.280 --> 03:15.200
So now that we have our redirect setup one more modification that we should make is to our action.

03:15.230 --> 03:18.970
So right now we saw that we're using this string.

03:19.040 --> 03:26.870
Hardcoded string right and in our reducer we're referencing the same string but one best practice that

03:26.870 --> 03:34.740
we can implement is to make sure that it's consistent in any place that might be referencing this string.

03:34.760 --> 03:40.280
So what we'll make is a new file called user dot type stuff.

03:40.280 --> 03:51.530
J us and what we're gonna export from this file will be an object called user action types and on it

03:51.530 --> 04:02.640
will be the value that points to that exact string and now in our reducer we are just going to import

04:02.640 --> 04:05.690
that in let's just

04:09.140 --> 04:16.640
use the autocomplete and it should be user action types and instead of set current user we will say

04:16.640 --> 04:20.440
see user action type stuff set current user.

04:20.450 --> 04:26.540
So now we know that it's constant and we won't have accidental typos and not know why our code is not

04:26.540 --> 04:38.340
working we'll do the same thing in our action or import user action types from our user types.

04:38.340 --> 04:45.070
Dot J us and we'll just use the value.

04:45.260 --> 04:49.020
And now if we look we see our code is still working the same.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.560
OK.

04:50.810 --> 04:59.390
So now we've done our modifications let's commit this code as well so we'll check the status and we'll

04:59.390 --> 05:13.190
say get ad get commit updating our app to redirect to home if user is signed and then we'll get push

05:15.810 --> 05:16.890
and let's keep building.
