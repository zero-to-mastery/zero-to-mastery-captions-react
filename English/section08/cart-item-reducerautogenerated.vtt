00:00.910 --> 00:07.830
So in the last lesson we finally styled our collection item component to have our hover.

00:07.870 --> 00:11.510
Add to Cart button in this section.

00:11.620 --> 00:19.270
Let's actually wire up the appropriate redux actions and read redux code so that this adds a cart button.

00:19.270 --> 00:26.550
Actually start saving these items into our cart reducer so the first thing we need to do in order to

00:26.550 --> 00:35.500
do this is we have to add the actual property we're trying to set inside of our reducer so inside of

00:35.500 --> 00:44.130
our application if we go to our cart reducer here we want to add a new property called cart items and

00:44.130 --> 00:51.270
very similar to when we hand a local state inside of a state full component such as a class component.

00:51.270 --> 00:57.910
We can set it in a very similar way with an empty array as the default value.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.840
Now what we need to do is we need to actually start adding items into this array or clearing them out

01:04.930 --> 01:11.850
depending on the feature and in this case what we want to do is we want to add items to this car items

01:11.850 --> 01:12.860
array.

01:13.020 --> 01:18.570
So what we're going to have to do is we are going to have to add both the new actions and the new action

01:18.570 --> 01:25.520
types so that our reducer is are aware of what ad item action we're trying to make.

01:25.520 --> 01:32.810
So what we'll do is we will go to our cart types here and inside we are going to make a new ad item

01:36.120 --> 01:39.750
and we are going to use this first inside of a reducer.

01:39.780 --> 01:43.970
So what we need to think about is how we're going to do this.

01:44.010 --> 01:50.520
Now I know that I mentioned in our final application that when we add items it will increase a quantity

01:50.550 --> 01:54.660
instead of displaying them in a multiplicative way.

01:54.780 --> 02:01.270
But let's just start with that because we want to work from small features into their complexity first.

02:01.380 --> 02:07.680
So all we're going to do is we are just going to add the item into the array whenever the user clicks

02:07.680 --> 02:08.100
it.

02:08.220 --> 02:13.500
If there's duplicates that's fine they'll just show up in the array as duplicates and we'll handle grouping

02:13.500 --> 02:15.340
them later.

02:15.350 --> 02:22.010
So what we're going to do is we are going to new and add a new case right underneath our first case

02:22.100 --> 02:30.740
with toggle car hidden called cart action types using our new AD item and what we'll say is we want

02:30.740 --> 02:36.560
to return an object with all of the state right as it is we'll spread it through.

02:36.800 --> 02:42.590
But now we want our car items array to be our old car items.

02:42.710 --> 02:46.050
And then with the newest action that got fired right.

02:46.100 --> 02:53.930
That is trigger add item we want to deposit whatever the item it is in the payload of that action into

02:53.960 --> 02:54.740
this array.

02:55.640 --> 03:04.140
So we'll first spread in the existing cart items that are already on our state and then what we're gonna

03:04.160 --> 03:11.790
do is we're just going to add the action payload to the end of this array so if you're unfamiliar with

03:11.790 --> 03:18.360
this all we're doing is we're spreading in all of our array values and then any additional values we

03:18.360 --> 03:25.620
add at the end will automatically appear in the very end of this array following all of our spread values

03:25.620 --> 03:34.330
from our existing array so if this seems kind of confusing it's ok don't worry once we write the action

03:34.450 --> 03:36.560
it will totally make sense.

03:36.580 --> 03:42.010
So just look at this right now what we're doing is we're getting the item payload right we're assuming

03:42.010 --> 03:48.400
that the item coming in will be what will be the payload value on our action what we need to do now

03:48.430 --> 03:55.030
is we actually need to write the action so let's actually do that inside of car.

03:55.050 --> 04:03.930
Actions What we want to do is we want to make a new action called add item to cart actually let's just

04:03.930 --> 04:12.010
call it an item what it will be is a function that gets the item that we want to add to that array that

04:12.010 --> 04:21.480
we just made and what will return is this new action type object where the type is our car action type

04:21.480 --> 04:29.340
start add item which will tell our producer Hey I'm trying to add this item and the payload will be

04:29.340 --> 04:30.820
equal to the item.

04:31.050 --> 04:38.040
So as you remember actions can have a type value and a payload value the payload value can be anything

04:38.040 --> 04:44.940
we want it to be and in our case we want it to be the item we're trying to add into our cart items array

04:46.030 --> 04:53.860
so now that we have this payload right inside of our action definition let's actually bring this into

04:53.950 --> 05:00.730
our components so that we can actually use it so what we need to do is we actually need to go back to

05:00.730 --> 05:08.440
our collection item and now we want to import in all of the redux bindings that give us access the same

05:08.440 --> 05:16.100
way that we saw when we did our toggle button so we need to import in connect from reactive redux

05:19.170 --> 05:24.270
and then we need to import in that new ad item action that we made.

05:24.270 --> 05:27.510
So let's just bring that in an item from

05:30.440 --> 05:41.110
redux heart cart action so with our new AD item we know that we need to create our map dispatch the

05:41.110 --> 05:41.650
props

05:44.540 --> 05:49.340
because we need to dispatch this new ad item and I'll show you what we're gonna do with this one because

05:49.340 --> 05:59.360
now we need to take in this new item object as well so map dispatch to props will be this function that

05:59.360 --> 06:00.320
gets a dispatch

06:02.930 --> 06:10.650
and what we'll say is that whenever there's an item it will get an item in as the property right of

06:10.650 --> 06:17.070
this function that will represent the ad item prop that gets passed in and then we will dispatch our

06:17.190 --> 06:29.420
ad item action creator passing the item in so all we're doing here is we are simply creating this new

06:29.420 --> 06:36.560
function that's a prop call ad item that will go into our collection item as the ad item function that

06:36.560 --> 06:37.910
we need to leverage.

06:38.360 --> 06:45.080
And then what we do is whenever we actually dispatch or call this function this function will receive

06:45.080 --> 06:49.040
the item as the property pass it into our ad item.

06:49.040 --> 06:55.880
Action creator which gives us back that object where the type is equal to AD item and the payload is

06:55.880 --> 07:02.520
equal to the item they got passed in and then we will dispatch that new object into our store and it

07:02.520 --> 07:10.230
will go through our redux flow so here we just need to make sure right because we're not actually taking

07:10.230 --> 07:17.130
any map state to props that we pass null as the first value and then we pass our map dispatch to props

07:17.250 --> 07:18.430
as the second value.

07:19.140 --> 07:26.190
So now we'll have access to this ad item dispatch into our props which we want to make sure that we

07:26.190 --> 07:33.580
d structure off but now is the interesting part because we actually need access to the item that this

07:33.580 --> 07:40.060
collection item represents now in order for us to actually dispatch it into our new AD item function

07:40.060 --> 07:41.260
that we wrote.

07:41.380 --> 07:45.110
So we need to actually tweak our code a little bit.

07:45.240 --> 07:50.820
The first thing that we need to do is we need to see where we're using our collection item which is

07:50.820 --> 07:52.590
our collection preview.

07:52.590 --> 07:56.610
Normally what we do is we just spread in all of the props.

07:56.670 --> 08:04.290
As you remember right from the item itself other than the I.D. because we use it as the key that is

08:04.290 --> 08:10.950
the idea value and then we spread everything else in as a prop which we then D structure off of our

08:10.950 --> 08:14.400
props object and use inside of our collection.

08:14.400 --> 08:22.100
Item instead what we want to do is we just want to pass the whole item in as item.

08:22.100 --> 08:32.290
So instead of doing it like this we are going to say that what we want is the whole item and then for

08:32.290 --> 08:40.520
the key we're still going to call item to I.D. except now we're going to pass item as the item.

08:40.540 --> 08:47.350
So as you see all we did was just simply pass the whole item in Key is still item I.D. still using the

08:47.350 --> 08:52.580
I.D. but now in our collection item we have access to our item object.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.530
Now we still need to use these values.

08:54.550 --> 09:01.880
So let's cut these out and what we'll do is we will do a explicit return of our function.

09:02.600 --> 09:08.030
So before when we had these round brackets we're just going to use our squiggly brackets which implies

09:08.030 --> 09:12.140
that we are rendering multiple javascript out of this function.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.980
We will make sure to return our component from this.

09:15.140 --> 09:22.010
But what we'll do inside of our new squiggly brackets is we will say const D structure these properties

09:22.010 --> 09:28.440
that we were destruction before from the props except I want you to d structure them off the item.

09:28.470 --> 09:35.190
Now the reason we're doing this is because we want these values still because we use them inside of

09:35.190 --> 09:38.610
our component definition but we need access to the item itself.

09:38.850 --> 09:41.520
So this way we actually have access to the item now.

09:41.730 --> 09:45.800
So we see that we're not using the I.D. So let's just remove that from here.

09:46.050 --> 09:56.080
And then on our custom button we'll say on click is this function that will fire calling our add item

09:56.140 --> 09:59.790
passing the item in.

09:59.980 --> 10:07.930
I know we wrote a lot of code just now just to set up our redux but this is actually a very simple flow.

10:07.930 --> 10:10.590
Once you get used to all of the moving parts.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.960
So let's actually first see it before we review this.

10:14.140 --> 10:19.890
Now that we've written this let's go to our application and now we'll see that whenever we click our

10:19.890 --> 10:25.170
add item to cart we're firing our new ad item action.

10:25.170 --> 10:32.280
The payload is that item that we have and we'll see inside of our actual cart reducer that our cart

10:32.310 --> 10:36.570
is updating and now we're displaying these items.

10:36.780 --> 10:43.620
And while they might not be grouped together even under the same item we can see that our redux action

10:43.620 --> 10:50.850
is working and it's firing whenever we click every time we click we're getting our ad item action to

10:50.850 --> 10:58.260
dispatch and our cart is getting updated in its car items with the newest thing that was being added

10:58.380 --> 11:06.470
appended to the end of our cart items array so if we just go over this one more time what we did was

11:06.500 --> 11:13.100
we had to make sure that we added the new value which was our cart items that we were trying to track

11:13.670 --> 11:22.580
into our initial state of our reducer then we had to make a new action that was going to represent what

11:22.580 --> 11:28.630
we were trying to do to modify that new property which is our car items array.

11:28.700 --> 11:35.870
Next we define the actual action itself which is our ad item which is a function that gets the item

11:36.170 --> 11:43.490
and generates this new action with the action type of ad item that we just made passing the item in

11:43.490 --> 11:52.930
as the payload which are reducer then has to listen for with the new case for that new action type that

11:52.930 --> 11:59.230
we just made so that whenever the action comes in we make sure that what we're doing is we're returning

11:59.230 --> 12:04.180
the new state of our over all cart reducer.

12:04.180 --> 12:12.930
So it has whatever existing hidden value is there except the carte items array is a new array.

12:13.060 --> 12:21.400
We have to make sure it's a new array where we spread in the existing card items except we append the

12:21.400 --> 12:26.800
new item that we get as a payload in at the end of this array.

12:26.840 --> 12:37.010
Finally we have to make sure that we update our actual collection item so that it pulls in to its props

12:37.310 --> 12:44.690
using the new map dispatch to props where we make sure that when we define the actual add item prop

12:44.690 --> 12:53.540
itself it's a function that gets whatever we want to pass in as the payload in as the property we then

12:53.540 --> 13:02.260
return the dispatch action on us creating our actual action using our ad item.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.780
Action creator that we defined as you remember right here.

13:06.650 --> 13:13.790
So as we here this returns the object which represents our new ad item action type as well as the payload

13:14.480 --> 13:18.130
which it then finally dispatches.

13:18.270 --> 13:21.530
I know this is a lot of redux juggling.

13:21.540 --> 13:25.110
It's like we're jumping back and forth between all these redux files right.

13:25.110 --> 13:30.280
Just to do something like this and this is kind of the overhead that comes with the bricks.

13:30.390 --> 13:37.170
But at the same time we've now defined this function that we can use anywhere on any component that

13:37.170 --> 13:44.790
allows us to add these items into the same array that we're using in different places in our application

13:44.790 --> 13:46.130
as well.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.220
So it's kind of the right tradeoff.

13:48.510 --> 13:55.980
It increases in this complexity but it gives us these beautiful reusable functions and reusable state

13:56.010 --> 13:59.730
that we can now leverage across the application.

13:59.730 --> 14:07.920
So now that we have our ad item action that adds to this array let's actually start grouping them so

14:07.920 --> 14:12.500
that we don't get these duplicates inside of this array.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
