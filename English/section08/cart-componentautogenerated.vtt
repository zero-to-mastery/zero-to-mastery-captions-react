00:01.020 --> 00:08.970
Now the next thing we're going to tackle is a pretty big feature and the feature is our cart.

00:09.780 --> 00:17.850
So if we go to our final application we'll see that our cart is represented as this shopping bag icon

00:17.940 --> 00:23.670
with a number inside that increases whenever you add items to it.

00:25.100 --> 00:33.440
Inside when you click this icon it will create this dropdown that shows you the items that you currently

00:33.440 --> 00:35.900
have in your cart.

00:35.900 --> 00:43.070
Now we have to keep in mind how we're going to store these items because if we go to our checkout we

00:43.130 --> 00:45.920
also see the same items.

00:45.920 --> 00:53.240
And if we start increasing the quantity here we actually see that our shopping icon is also increasing

00:53.240 --> 01:02.470
in that number so this seems like it's two places in the application that uses the same state which

01:02.470 --> 01:09.370
is perfect for what we know about redux because we know that these two components are going to share

01:09.370 --> 01:12.270
the same state.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.270
Now how do we build this.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.440
Well there's a lot going on here.

01:17.510 --> 01:24.750
So in this section we're going to put together a lot of the concepts that we just learned and expand

01:24.750 --> 01:34.550
upon them to build this exciting feature so let's go back to our application code and what we first

01:34.550 --> 01:40.660
need to do is bring in the actual SPG for the shopping bag icon.

01:40.700 --> 01:46.580
Now I've already provided it for you so you can just add it into this folder of our assets

01:49.490 --> 01:55.560
and inside of our assets you are just going to drop the SPG and so I'm just going to copy and paste

01:55.560 --> 02:09.010
it in and then what we'll do is make the actual car icon component that represents both the icon and

02:09.010 --> 02:10.100
the number.

02:10.210 --> 02:18.740
So when our components let's make a cart icon component an inside will need our cart icon component

02:18.850 --> 02:28.370
dodgy OSX and our cart icon dot styles dot size.

02:28.400 --> 02:39.480
So first of all import in react from react will import in our style she and we're also going to import

02:39.570 --> 02:41.500
in our shopping icon.

02:41.550 --> 02:55.850
So we're gonna do react component as shopping icon from and then the year all of our SPG assets shopping

02:55.850 --> 02:59.030
backed up that's.

02:59.070 --> 03:01.920
Now what we're gonna write is a concept.

03:01.930 --> 03:15.140
Carl Icahn equals a functional component that renders a div and this div is going to have the class

03:15.140 --> 03:30.020
name of cart icon because it will hold both our shopping icon as well as our span that will represent

03:32.470 --> 03:35.440
our total number of items.

03:35.520 --> 03:41.080
Now for this span we're just going to say item count as its class name.

03:41.390 --> 03:47.980
And for our shopping icon we're gonna give it the class name of shopping icon

03:50.750 --> 04:00.110
and then let's export out by default our cart icon is spelled Defoe.

04:00.150 --> 04:08.020
Now I have provided for you the styling for this card icon as I usually do and you can just paste this

04:08.110 --> 04:16.030
into your cart icon styles but all I'm doing is I'm pretty much just setting our item count to be positioned

04:16.120 --> 04:21.500
above and absolutely in the middle of our shopping icon.

04:21.500 --> 04:29.160
So now let's bring this into our header component.

04:29.200 --> 04:40.830
Now let's import in cart icon from cart icon card icon component and let's just drop it at the very

04:40.890 --> 04:44.400
end of our header.

04:44.430 --> 04:51.290
Now if we save and look at our code we see that we have our kite icon now right now.

04:51.300 --> 04:59.080
None of that functionality is tied to it but we have our icon component in the next section.

04:59.100 --> 05:06.960
We are going to actually start building out the dropdown and all of the redux that's going to be associated

05:06.960 --> 05:07.890
to setting that up.
