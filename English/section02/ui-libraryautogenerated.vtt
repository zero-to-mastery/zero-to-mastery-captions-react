WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:06.870
So we've learned that react takes care of Dom changes for us using something called virtual Dawn.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.750
We learn that we build the Web sites with components.

00:09.910 --> 00:16.180
And this idea of you need directional data flow where data only flows one way so that it's easier to

00:16.480 --> 00:18.370
debug our code.

00:18.370 --> 00:26.090
Then the final thing that really made react stand out is this idea of hey I'm just the UI.

00:26.230 --> 00:28.580
The rest is up to you.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.060
What do you mean by this well.

00:32.100 --> 00:40.930
Remember how with angular it came with all these things built in that is angular J.S..

00:41.110 --> 00:46.000
It was a framework and a framework is kind of like a whole kitchen.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.770
It gives the developers all the tools necessary to build an application.

00:51.790 --> 00:57.550
So if you're a cook in a kitchen while you get the oven you get the nice you get the drawers you get

00:57.550 --> 00:58.620
the pots and pans.

00:58.630 --> 01:01.230
You have the stove you have everything for you.

01:01.240 --> 01:07.140
And this is how you cook or this is how you build a Web site.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.060
It's very opinionated.

01:10.150 --> 01:17.620
On the other hand react said Hey I only care about this whole idea of components and virtual DOM and

01:17.620 --> 01:26.050
I only am going to work with the view the user interface everything else that you need while you can

01:26.050 --> 01:34.690
just use other modules other libraries and mix and match and have whatever you want customized to your

01:34.690 --> 01:35.510
need.

01:35.530 --> 01:39.990
So it was a library a UI library which is not like a kitchen.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.460
It's more like let's say the stove they gave you the stove to cook your soup on but everything else

01:48.580 --> 01:52.370
like knife cutting board spoon.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.400
Well you can pick whichever one you want.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.190
It's up to you what you use to build that soup.

01:57.220 --> 02:07.920
All we give you is this oven and the key idea was that because it was so small you can learn once and

02:07.920 --> 02:10.270
write anywhere.

02:10.320 --> 02:10.950
What does that mean.

02:11.430 --> 02:19.290
Well react doesn't make assumptions about what technology stack you use all we give you is hey here

02:19.320 --> 02:27.210
is this idea of components of a blueprint that we can use a massive javascript object to make changes.

02:27.300 --> 02:36.170
And here's also a robot that will interact with the Dom and makes changes for you but because of this

02:36.800 --> 02:43.880
we actually are able because it only focuses with the UI we're actually able to move react to other

02:43.880 --> 02:51.920
places other than well let's say the Web for example we now can have different robots that interact

02:51.920 --> 03:01.250
with different views and all they need is this main react library or blueprint of how to well look at

03:01.250 --> 03:05.540
a javascript object and say hey change this UI.

03:06.110 --> 03:13.370
So now you could have things like react native and this little robot can look at this blueprint and

03:13.370 --> 03:20.270
say change the view in a Iow app an Android app.

03:20.270 --> 03:27.210
And although it might not know anything about the DOM it only needs to know about views in a mobile

03:27.210 --> 03:28.010
app.

03:28.050 --> 03:36.990
You also have things like react 360 which is VR apps and again using this blueprint of react I can use

03:36.990 --> 03:42.640
it for VR apps and this little robot or library can focus on VR.

03:42.690 --> 03:49.050
We also have things like electron and react desktop that allows us to build desktop applications and

03:49.050 --> 03:55.530
they interact with Windows and Mac OS and Linux operating systems.

03:55.530 --> 04:02.900
We even have things like react to blessed that work with the terminal and the command prompt and because

04:02.900 --> 04:12.320
of this react was able to use this concept and have developers that originally just wrote for Web sites

04:12.710 --> 04:19.760
on the browser to now use the same idea and the same principles and the same javascript code to build

04:19.790 --> 04:25.700
desktop applications to build VR applications to build mobile applications.

04:25.700 --> 04:33.640
And this idea of cross platform really took off with react and you'll notice when we start building

04:33.640 --> 04:40.630
our projects that we actually import to libraries and react the core react library which is this little

04:40.630 --> 04:49.120
robot and the react dorm library which is this specific robot that only knows how to interact with the

04:49.120 --> 04:51.220
dorm or the web browser.
