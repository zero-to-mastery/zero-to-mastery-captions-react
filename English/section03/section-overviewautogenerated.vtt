00:00.800 --> 00:04.020
Let's get started with react basics.

00:04.400 --> 00:11.450
Now if you've taken any of my previous courses where I've taught react or you're not a react beginner

00:11.900 --> 00:18.230
and you've built some applications before with react then you can actually just skim through these videos

00:18.350 --> 00:23.260
or skip this entire section as this section covers the react basics.

00:23.270 --> 00:29.060
We're going to build our first react application from scratch using something called Create react app

00:29.330 --> 00:33.160
and then we're going to deploy it to get help pages again.

00:33.240 --> 00:39.210
If you're completely new to react then you have to finish this section to move on with the course.

00:39.210 --> 00:43.500
However for those with a bit of experience you might find this section a little bit easy.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.200
Determine for yourself which direction you want to go remember.

00:48.200 --> 00:55.160
Our goal here is to build these basics so that we can build our giant application our e-commerce platform

00:55.220 --> 00:56.680
using react.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.990
Now in this section we're gonna learn a few things.

00:59.990 --> 01:04.000
However we're going to make a few assumptions here.

01:04.010 --> 01:11.800
First we're going to assume you know how to use your terminal or your command prompt and you can also

01:11.800 --> 01:19.570
use any code editor you want you can use Visual Studio code Sublime Text or any other popular javascript

01:19.570 --> 01:21.720
developer environments.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.290
Now this section is going to be a code along.

01:24.560 --> 01:31.610
So I highly recommend if you're following along to have your terminal or command prompt setup if you're

01:31.610 --> 01:39.620
on Windows Terminal if you're on mac or linux system and have your code editor so you follow along.

01:39.620 --> 01:45.560
Now over the next couple of videos we're going to install node if you don't have it already.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.160
And also the create react app that is going to allow us to write react.

01:50.210 --> 01:54.970
I do want to make a few notes though first with this course.

01:55.010 --> 02:00.340
As long as you have a version 10 or higher for node you're going to be fine.

02:00.770 --> 02:10.160
If you don't have a version of node on your system that is 10 or lower then I recommend updating node

02:10.790 --> 02:17.330
or if not you can use something called End VM and end VM is a node version manager.

02:17.390 --> 02:23.550
So it's a simple way in the terminal for us to switch node versions.

02:23.580 --> 02:29.420
Now this is something you can go through on your own the easiest way to do things is to just simply

02:29.570 --> 02:32.450
download node from the node j J.S..

02:32.550 --> 02:33.530
Dot org Web site.

02:34.680 --> 02:41.280
Now the second thing we're going to do is we're going to actually install something called Create react.

02:41.730 --> 02:50.660
And if I go to react J.S. talk here and I go to Doc's under the create a new react app.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.720
We have this thing called Create react app which we're gonna talk about in the upcoming video.

02:55.720 --> 03:03.220
Now the one thing I want to mention is that you'll see this command and p x and MP X is actually new

03:03.850 --> 03:14.310
and comes with version of NPM 5.2 so if your NPM version is lower than this this command won't work

03:15.310 --> 03:18.090
so you might want to update your NPM version as well.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.470
Now MP X for those that haven't seen it before.

03:22.580 --> 03:27.370
Runs a command of a package without installing it explicit.

03:28.010 --> 03:29.810
So what does that mean.

03:29.810 --> 03:35.300
Well before we had MP X this is what we had to do.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.680
You see here that this is the current version of react based on when you're watching the video you might

03:39.680 --> 03:41.400
have versions that are higher.

03:41.450 --> 03:46.040
But again this course will work with any versions higher than sixteen point eight.

03:46.100 --> 03:50.780
If I go here and go to an older version of React let's say fifteen point six.

03:50.780 --> 03:57.560
If I click on documentation and then let's do docs and then finally we look at the installation

04:00.970 --> 04:08.440
you'll see that we had to run npm install globally create reactor and then we ran the create react up

04:08.440 --> 04:10.820
command to create our app.

04:10.840 --> 04:17.680
MP X allows us to not install this global version of create react app and just simply run that one comment

04:17.860 --> 04:19.820
to create our app.

04:19.820 --> 04:28.950
All right now let's go back if for some reason during this section you are unable to get this started.

04:29.020 --> 04:35.410
There is a another option where you can use this code sandbox style which I'll link to that actually

04:35.410 --> 04:40.980
allows you within the browser to use react online.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.090
Now one last thing we're gonna get started and go step by step into building our ReACT application.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.580
But I also want to point something out to you.

04:49.700 --> 04:58.010
You see when we study or learn libraries or frameworks or tools like react the best place to learn about

04:58.010 --> 05:05.210
something is often the documentation and most tutorials don't mentioned this fact that well we have

05:05.720 --> 05:12.980
the official react documentation that explains how we act works inside and out and most tutorials that

05:12.980 --> 05:16.550
you see online are taught using this basic template.

05:16.970 --> 05:21.980
So remember if you ever have questions this is always the best place to start.

05:23.160 --> 05:27.380
Now we're going to be covering some main concepts and react here.

05:27.720 --> 05:33.810
But remember that the way you learn a library is not like reading a dictionary where you just learn

05:33.930 --> 05:37.230
every single thing that this library gives you.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.680
The thing to understand that we'll go into later on in this course is how to build bigger and bigger

05:43.680 --> 05:44.460
applications.

05:44.460 --> 05:52.200
How to architect your app so that instead of learning something like a dictionary one by one we learn

05:52.200 --> 05:58.350
the principles and the concepts that allow us to do advanced things and build real life applications

05:58.590 --> 06:01.390
something that I'm really excited to do in this course.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.700
So enough talk it's time for us to get started.

06:04.710 --> 06:07.800
We're going to start setting up our environment in the next video.

06:07.870 --> 06:11.420
We're going to build our first app and it's gonna be a fun one.

06:11.550 --> 06:12.350
I'll see you on that one.

06:12.350 --> 06:12.740
Bye bye.
