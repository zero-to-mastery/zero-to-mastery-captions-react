WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:07.620
OK so now we're going to start converting our current application to look more like the final application

00:08.460 --> 00:09.750
before we do that.

00:09.810 --> 00:14.810
We've got to take a look at this idea of components.

00:14.880 --> 00:21.920
So right now we do know that are only component is the app component.

00:21.960 --> 00:22.250
Right.

00:22.260 --> 00:28.570
We've only written this one single class based component which is our app.

00:29.400 --> 00:37.830
However in react what we want to do is we want to be able to break our code into smaller reusable pieces

00:38.400 --> 00:42.630
that are only focused on one responsibility.

00:42.630 --> 00:43.190
Right.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.950
So when we look at this we see that this card seems to be its own component.

00:50.100 --> 00:57.120
This search bar is its own component and in a way because this card is itself it doesn't really care

00:57.150 --> 00:59.730
about the other cards around it.

00:59.730 --> 01:06.000
So there's got to be something that seems to be containing every single card on our page.

01:06.570 --> 01:08.790
And that is going to be another component.

01:08.790 --> 01:16.410
Now when we build that outside wrapping component we're going to actually take a deeper look into what

01:16.410 --> 01:19.150
components are in react.

01:19.350 --> 01:30.830
So let's first make a components folder and inside we will make a card list folder and in that card

01:30.830 --> 01:36.610
list folder we're going to make a card list dot component dot JSF.

01:36.890 --> 01:42.380
Now you don't need this stock component part but I like to add it just so that I can tell right away

01:42.440 --> 01:44.810
what kind of file that is.

01:44.810 --> 01:55.410
So this is our component file and we need to import react from react and we're going to export out this

01:55.410 --> 01:57.160
card list right.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.700
And it's going to be a functional component.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.450
And what we want to display for now is just a containing div.

02:04.500 --> 02:12.390
Now one of the big things about components is that they take in something called Props and props is

02:12.390 --> 02:17.300
going to be the parameter that we get from our functional component.

02:17.310 --> 02:18.510
Right.

02:18.540 --> 02:25.140
So right now let's just log this out and see what this looks like because it's important for us to know

02:25.170 --> 02:33.030
what props actually are and inside of this div I'm just going to put how low for now and let's console

02:33.300 --> 02:34.500
logout props.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.690
Right.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.670
So now we know that we're logging it out when we put it on our actual application and we're going to

02:41.760 --> 02:47.140
import it into our app file import card list

02:50.670 --> 02:55.960
components card list card let's component.

02:55.990 --> 03:00.550
Now let's just put this above here for now and let's not put anything into it.

03:00.550 --> 03:06.560
Now you remember earlier when I said that there are these this props parameter.

03:06.580 --> 03:07.120
Right.

03:07.150 --> 03:12.970
This is actually going to be any parameter that we pass into card list.

03:12.970 --> 03:20.530
So if here we say there is a prop called name and we pass in e law.

03:20.710 --> 03:21.040
Right.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.260
Then what will actually log out when we look at our app.

03:25.570 --> 03:27.860
Is this card list that says name.

03:27.910 --> 03:28.270
Right.

03:28.270 --> 03:32.590
And then it says Iva so right there is our card list component.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.820
And right here you see that we're actually locking it out.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.370
We're logging out E.

03:37.690 --> 03:38.310
Right.

03:38.320 --> 03:44.140
So that prop is going to be an object of any properties that you write onto this component where it

03:44.140 --> 03:46.790
gets used now.

03:46.800 --> 03:52.980
Generally speaking of course we want the props that we're actually going to pass in to match the parameters

03:52.980 --> 03:55.770
that we're actually gonna use instead of our component.

03:55.860 --> 04:05.290
But one of the main properties that exists on this props object is one called children it will always

04:05.290 --> 04:08.410
be there but it if there's no children it'll be null.

04:08.410 --> 04:18.600
So what are children children are actually what you pass in between the brackets of our component that

04:18.600 --> 04:19.740
gets called.

04:19.740 --> 04:26.540
So if in here I say e are then the children prop will be this yeehaw.

04:26.820 --> 04:27.260
Right.

04:27.300 --> 04:35.180
Actually I'm even going to make it an H want just so that I can show that it's anything in between these

04:35.780 --> 04:36.290
tags.

04:37.040 --> 04:44.780
So now if we instead render a prop stop children gotta remember to use the squiggly brackets because

04:44.960 --> 04:49.720
that tells that we're going to use javascript and now we see Iowa.

04:50.480 --> 04:57.480
And this is an H1 as well so that's one of the big things about props and components.

04:57.540 --> 05:03.120
We actually have access to props as well on our app component on the this keyword.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.720
It gets attached to our actual class as a property called Props.

05:07.770 --> 05:13.470
So if we want to access it we would use this stop props but because we're not using it yet there's no

05:13.470 --> 05:14.370
reason to do so.

05:14.490 --> 05:18.120
But in a later lesson we'll actually see what that will look like.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.720
But for now let's just focus on our card list.

05:20.910 --> 05:23.130
So we're adding in these prompts.

05:23.220 --> 05:23.520
Right.

05:23.520 --> 05:29.790
We're passing the children in because we do want that and then we're going to actually do some of the

05:29.790 --> 05:33.330
styling to make it look more like this.

05:33.390 --> 05:38.720
So we noticed that this is in kind of like a four column grid.

05:38.760 --> 05:44.280
Well I actually have some of the CSX written already for us that you guys can get from the file but

05:44.340 --> 05:49.680
I'm just going to include it and I don't want to focus too much on the CSX because it might be a little

05:49.680 --> 05:53.730
bit too much to think about when we're trying to learn react right now.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.840
But there is one thing I want to highlight.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.280
So first let's make a card list.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.680
Dot style's dot CSX and let's add that it.

06:03.880 --> 06:09.050
So all I'm saying really really quickly is that I'm ad I'm using the new CSX grid right.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.650
I'm setting the display to grid.

06:11.720 --> 06:21.320
I am saying that I want the grid to make everything fit within four of these columns each one being

06:21.320 --> 06:29.180
the size of one fraction which is essentially an equal part of the overall size of what the width of

06:29.180 --> 06:31.340
this cordless will be.

06:31.340 --> 06:36.020
So there's just four equal columns and then between each column there will be 20 pixels.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.120
So let's use it and see what it looks like.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.180
So it's import that in

06:44.460 --> 06:51.480
and then let's put it on so let's get rid of this for now and let's put it on.

06:51.690 --> 06:57.610
So our class name will be card if we save it.

06:57.900 --> 07:01.940
We will see now that it was in here.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.260
Right.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.820
But we want everything in there as well.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.060
Right.

07:04.090 --> 07:13.570
So now instead of passing you all through I want to pass all of our monsters through right.

07:13.570 --> 07:18.880
So again this map is going to generate our list of those H ones the same way.

07:18.880 --> 07:25.900
But then it's going to put it as the children in between this div that we have as our card list component

07:27.470 --> 07:34.440
and now if we look we see that it's in an equal grid of four equal columns.

07:34.550 --> 07:40.460
So this is a really really fundamental thing about react is that we're just building components that

07:40.520 --> 07:49.010
only care about one thing and our card lists component only cares about displaying cards inside of it

07:49.100 --> 07:51.800
in some kind of configuration.

07:51.800 --> 07:59.970
Right now the next thing we're going to look at in the next lesson is taking that idea a step further

08:00.060 --> 08:05.280
and we're going to apply it to this card component next see in the next one.
